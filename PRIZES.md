## Kite AI
### $10000 Agent Native Payments & Identity on Kite AI (x402 powered)
Build an agent-native application on Kite AI using x402 payments and verifiable agent identity. Projects should demonstrate autonomous agents that can authenticate, pay, and transact across Web3 or Web2-style APIs with minimal human intervention.

Kite AI is the first purpose built AI payment chain designed for autonomous AI agents where software programs don’t just think intelligently, but transact, coordinate, and operate economically at scale.

AI agents are rapidly evolving; they can reason, plan, negotiate, and act on our behalf, but the systems that move value, like cards, bank rails, or human-centric blockchain patterns, weren’t built for them. That’s the core bottleneck in realizing the agentic economy.

Kite gives these agents their own economic rails with native support for pay-per-action micropayments, cryptographic identity, verifiable execution, and automated settlement, with near-instant finality and ultra-low cost.

🏆 Winner Breakdown
1st Place gets $5,000

2nd Place gets $3,000

3rd Place gets $2,000

📝 Requirements
The bot must transact on Base mainnet and have a goal of being self-sustaining.
Transactions must integrate ERC-8021 builder codes, which can be accessed by registering on base.dev
It must be autonomous with minimal to no human intervention
✅ What does a successful project look like?
Your bot is fully autonomous and revenue generating enough so that you do not need to provide additional funds for the underlying model’s compute
The bot implements novel and unique ways to be self sustaining, going beyond what has already been done so far in the space
The bot integrates with standards such as x402 and EIP8004 to more seamlessly transact and interact onchain
Every onchain transaction includes builder codes, giving the agent and its operator analytics and insights into its usage.

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
The agent must have an interface at a publicly accessible url which allows judges (and the operator) to view stats on its compute cost and wallet balance
There must not be any password or code required to judge. Non-judges must be able to access the interface at the public url as well
It must be at a public url. Judges will not download repos locally
The interface can be very simple, but interfaces which improve the clarity of the bots performance will influence the overall score

🧑‍⚖️ How are we judging it?
How autonomous is the agent?
Is it successful in being self-sustaining?
Does it implement builder codes?
Is the bot’s performance clear from the interface at the public url?
Does it leverage net new and unique methods, primarily onchain, to generate enough revenue to be self sustaining
